Penn State Senior 2025 Senior Project - DIGIT 494

Welcome to my website, where I share my passion for all things horror! This platform is dedicated to providing in-depth reviews and insights into horror films — from the timeless classics to the latest chilling releases. My goal is to create a dynamic, interactive space where horror enthusiasts can explore, discuss, and dive into the genre's darkest corners.

As the site evolves, I plan to introduce a community-driven section where fellow fans can contribute their thoughts, share reviews, and engage in lively discussions about the films that frighten, thrill, and captivate us all. Whether you're here to read my thoughts or connect with others who share your love for horror, I hope this site becomes your go-to spot for everything terrifyingly cinematic!

I've decided to adjust my approach to this website for the time being. 
My goal is to have it fully functioning, but since this is my senior project,
I’ve decided to hold off on launching it until I’ve secured the necessary 
permissions. Since I’m pulling information from other websites using 
BeautifulSoup4, I need to ensure I have the proper authorization before 
making the website publicly available.
