#Horror Movie Blog

Penn State Senior 2025 Senior Project - DIGIT 494

Welcome to my website, where I share my passion for all things horror! This platform is dedicated to providing in-depth reviews and insights into horror films â€” from the timeless classics to the latest chilling releases. My goal is to create a dynamic, interactive space where horror enthusiasts can explore, discuss, and dive into the genre's darkest corners.

As the site evolves, I plan to introduce a community-driven section where fellow fans can contribute their thoughts, share reviews, and engage in lively discussions about the films that frighten, thrill, and captivate us all. Whether you're here to read my thoughts or connect with others who share your love for horror, I hope this site becomes your go-to spot for everything terrifyingly cinematic!

Here is the domain name: horrormoviereview.kesug.com
There are a lot of forms as well that walk you through setting up github to push to the websites. 

It can take up to 72 hours to become available to the public.
